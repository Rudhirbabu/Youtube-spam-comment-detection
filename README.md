# Youtube-spam-comment-detection
YouTube Spam comments typically appear perfectly normal until examined in a large context. The standard approach to classifying reviews independently ignores these relations. In this study, we propose YouTube multi-modal feature extractor, event discriminator, and spam detector.

 We propose a novel methodology for detecting intrusive comments or spam on the video-sharing website - YouTube in this work. We describe spam comments like those with a promotional intent or those deemed contextually irrelevant for a given video. This work proposes to apply multiple algorithms Logistic Regression Classifier, Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine(SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifiers for classification of YouTube spam comment. Feature extraction from text using methods such as CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. Our proposed multi-modal approaches with remarkable results achieved.
